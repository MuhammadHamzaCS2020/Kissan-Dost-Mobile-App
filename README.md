# Abstract
An online shopping system that permits a customer to submit online orders for items and/or
services from a store that serves both walk-in customers and online customers. The online shopping
system presents an online display of an order cut off time and an associated delivery window for items
selected by the customer. The aim of this project is to make a farmer’s friendly shopping site where
farmers act as vendors. Normal shopping sites enable only the website owner to sell their products but
this platform enables every farmer to sell their products.

KISSAN DOST is a farmer-friendly interface where farmers can sell their farm products at a
profitable price. Basically, it’s a shopping site where customers can buy fruits, vegetables and crops
directly from farmers. This online shopping site provides farmers with an option of filling their goods
information and buyers can buy the products which farmers want to sell. Thus the site helps farmers to
sell their goods produced.
